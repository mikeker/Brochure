This project contains the make file and feature modules needed to build a basic
"brochure" Web site.

Features include:

  - Basic pages
  - "Blog"-type content type and views
  - Front page slideshow content type and views
  - Basic media support (Flickr, YouTube, uploaded images)
  - Image overlay by Shadowbox
  - Rich-text editor (CKEditor)
  - Sets up some placeholder pages and content

To use, build a distribution make (distro.make) file consisting of

  core = 7.x
  api = 2
  projects[] = drupal
  
  ; Brochure
  ; --------
  projects[brochure][type] = module
  projects[brochure][subdir] = custom
  projects[brochure][download][type] = git
  projects[brochure][download][url] = git://github.com/mikeker/brochure.git

and execute it using "drush make distro.make <path to installation>"
(eg: "drush make distro.make new_site" will install Drupal at new_site/index.php).
Drush Make will recursively run make files it finds, so the brochure.make
will be executed when distro.make is executed.

@TODO: Build an install profile out of this so that we can setup users and placeholder content.

After executing the distro.make file, do the following:
  - Setup database, database user, and adjust settings.php accordingly.
    (See http://drupal.org/documentation/install/create-database)
  - Visit install.php on your localhost to setup Drupal using the default install profile.
  - Then run the following:
      drush dis toolbar
      drush en admin_menu admin_menu_toolbar backup_migrate better_formats boost ctools fontyourface google_fonts_api globalredirect less devel features pathologic media media_youtube omega_tools pathauto strongarm shadowbox wysiwyg views views_ui views_slideshow_cycle service_links mollom
      drush omega-subtheme "My Site Theme"
      @TODO:  uuid uuid_features?
  - Then turn on which features you want:
